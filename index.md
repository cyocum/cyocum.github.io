A place to communicate occasional topics concerning the [IrishGen
database](https://github.com/cyocum/irish-gen). The focus will be on
difficulties and solutions to translating medieval Irish genealogical
information from manuscript sources to Linked Data and other
information retrieval systems.

If you have used IrishGen for your project and wish to publish a short
paper on your experience or on an aspect of the intersection between
early Medieval Ireland and information storage and retrieval
techniques, please contact the email address: <a
