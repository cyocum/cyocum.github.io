#Introduction
The genealogical relationships encoded in IrishGen are by and large congruous with what one would expect, given the basic constraints of biological reproduction. For example, an individual usually has a maximum of two other individuals specified as their parents and their descendants are usually distinct from their ancestors. Where incongruities occur, this is often due to errors made on the part of the project curators. Steps are currently being taken to minimise such errors through a proofing process. Incongruities can also occur due to errors in the editions from which the curators work. An example of this has been explored in [a previous blogpost](https://cyocum.github.io/2020/06/14/Emendations-to-Source-Editions-on-IrishGen.html).

Even where the pre-modern source texts are being represented accurately, however, anomalies can occur in the structure of the genealogies, as encoded in IrishGen. This can be due to errors in the source texts themselves or due contradictory alternative versions of the same information from different sources, but it can also be due to unexpected twists in the source texts' accounts of familial structures and biological relationships. This blogpost looks at some illustrative examples of such structures within IrishGen's data so as to alert users to the nuance required when handling the data even when it is accurate.
