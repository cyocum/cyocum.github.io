## Introduction

This post intends to cover many of the underlying technical
specifications and formats that IrishGen uses, including design
decisions and trade-offs.  This will help orient readers to the
IrishGen dataset and the technical environment which it inhabits.  A
careful reading of this will aid the reader who wants to use IrishGen
in their own research and study. The audience for this post should be
more familiar with the structure of the early Irish verb, for
instance, than the structure of a file format.

## Resource Description Framework

Before we begin looking into the problems in detail, a tour of the
technical ecosystem and a set of definitions of terms would be useful
for those not already familiar with them.  More experienced readers
may wish to skip this section.

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a
[standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/)
definied by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org) which
is meant to represent data on the World Wide Web.  While the history
of the framework and its various incarnations will be interesting to
anyone who wants more information about the failure of grand ambitions
of the early years of the web, the point here is that the RDF
specification sets the theoretical underpinning for data on the web
and thus the way that data is handled in IrishGen.

RDF defines a particular kind of graph database which is also known as
a Knowledge Graph (see "[Knowledge
Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02320)" for an extremely
comprehensive introduction to the topic).  The structure is relatively
simple with only three active elements: the subject, the predicate,
and the object.  These three elements are defined and combined in
different ways to create a flexible way to represent data.  One of the
more odd features of RDF is that everything is a
[URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/), which can cause initial
confusion.

While RDF is a theoretical construct, a means of expressing this
consruct was necessary.  For this, several file formats (also known as
"serializations") which conform to the framework were created.  Among
the most common are:
[RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/),
[Notation3](https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/)
[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/),
[TRiG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/),
[JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/).  IrishGen uses the TRiG
file format but it can be automatically translated into any of the
other formats as needed.

## RDF Formats and IrishGen: An Example

An example fragment which is [adapted from
IrishGen](https://github.com/cyocum/irish-gen/blob/master/LL/dal_corpri_arad.trig)
will help to see what the above is in practice:

```turtle
<http://example.com/LL/dal_corpri_arad.trig#Flaithbertach> 
<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> 
<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> 
<http://example.com/LL>
```

The reader will notice that there are four URLs rather than three as
stated above.  This is because IrishGen uses the [RDF
Dataset](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-dataset) of
which TRiG is the seralisation.  This introduces the "quad" which is
useful for organising RDF.  The full usefulness of the quad will
become more apparent later but should be noted now so the reader is
not confused.  URLs are always surrounded by `<` and `>` to
distinguish them from other forms of text.

The first line is the subject of the RDF statement.  If one thinks of
this as a sentence, the first URL is in the subject position.  This is
the URL about which the statement makes an assertion (see [Handbook of
Knowledge Representation](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968676609) for
a more formal defintion of terms like TBox and ABox).  The subject can
be any URL, even one that you cannot dereference, as in the instance
above `http://example.com` is a dummy URL, which IrishGen uses as we
do not have the resources to maintain a website at the current time.
The reason that this works is due to RDF's Open World Assumption (see
[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1021874142), pp. 208-385) which
means that a RDF aware computer system reading this will assume that
`http://example.com/LL/dal_corpri_arad.trig#Flaithbertach` exists
irrespective of if it is available at the time the system becomes
aware of it or not.  This can cause some problems which will be
covered at the end of this post.

The second line is the predicate of the RDF statement.  Much thought
and discussion goes into this element of a quad as it contains within
it the ability to _reason_ about the graph using first order logic
(see Artificial Intelligence, pp. 251-313).  Reasoning in terms of RDF
will be more fully explored later but, to anticipate, the ability to
reason about the graph was a decisive factor when choosing to use RDF
over any other graph database technology.

The third line is the object of the RDF statement.  This is the effect
that applying the predicate will have on the subject.  In some cases
this can be as simple as giving the subject a static label (such as
given the proper nominal of their forename) and in more complex cases
can involve other subjects elsewhere defined on the web.

The effect of these four statements when translated into English is
"In LL, Flaithbertach is a person".  While this might seem trite in
English, it is very important to distinguish Flaithbertach from any
other kind of thing that may exist on the web.

As the reader can see, this would be very cumbersome for humans to
either create or read.  Thus, Notation3 is not often used in practice.
A more human readable format is Turtle of which TRiG is a slight
extension.  For example, the above can be written

```turtle
@base <http://example.com/LL/dal_corpri_arad.trig> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

<http://example.com/LL> {
  <#Flaithbertach> a foaf:Person 
}
```

This is a much condensed and in a way easier to read version of the
above.  Turtle (and by extension TRiG) condenses the format by moving
common elements to the beginning of the file and giving sensible
defaults.  In the above, the URL which defines Flaithbertach to the
system is pulled mostly into the `@base` which means that any URL
fragment will be given this full URL when read by the system.  The URL
`<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> ` is merely given a
default expression as `a` due to the fact that is used often.  `foaf:`
is declared at the top of the file and reused.  In IrishGen, there are
many people as they make up the majority of the data so keeping it
short is a good idea.

## Ontologies and IrishGen

At this point a reader may wonder where predicates come from.  This is
an entirely reasonable subject to consider at this point.  Predicates
may come from one of two sources.  The first is the RDF specification
itself which defines a few, general purpose predicates.  The other,
and far more complex, source is two specifications: [RDF
Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) (RDFS) and the Web Ontology
Language (OWL), which has two versions (see [Web Ontology Language
Reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/) for version one and [OWL 2
Web Ontology Language Document Overview (Second
Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) for version two).  For
all practical purposes, OWL 2 is the _de facto_ source for all
predicates in IrishGen even if they are declared with an RDFS URL.

IrishGen has extended and modified various publically avaliable
ontologies and created a few of its own to more accurately model the
situation in the medieval Irish genealogical source material.  For
instance, IrishGen has added the idea of `PopulationGroup` which are
fairly common entities in the geneaologies and the ability of persons
to be ancestors or decendants of these groups (for implementations of
these predicates and other predicates see the [Early Irish
Relationships
Ontology](https://github.com/cyocum/irish-gen/blob/master/earlyIrishRelationship.ttl)).

Ontologies allow new predicates to be added and thus new things to be
expressed about data in a RDF dataset.

A brief aside concerning databases will be useful at this point.
While all of the above deals with file formats and defining data,
actually searching that data is notibly absent.  Searching collections
of RDF datasets involves the use of a database technology called a
Triplestore.  There are many open source and commercial Triplestores
in use but the IrishGen is generally used with
[GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) or
[Stardog](https://www.stardog.com/).  Querying RDF is a deep and
complicated subject that will be reserved for another post where the
implications can be properly explored in depth.

## Difficulties and Challenges of Using RDF

Now that the reader is aquainted with the various parts of RDF and its
ecosystem of terms.  The choices made do not come without cost and
without their own challenges.  This section will explore some of them
that IrishGen has encountered over the years and give some solutions
to those which may be of interest to readers.

Human error is the bane for may digital curation projects.  IrishGen
is no less effected.  While typos are generally an annoyance, in
IrishGen, they can cause entire systems to go awry.  A case in point,
a vast number of the entries in IrishGen have the form below:

```turtle
<#Flaithbertach>
    a foaf:Person;
    irishRel:nomName "Flaithbertach";
    rel:childOf <#Crunmael>.
```

This states that Flaithbertach is a person who has the nominative name
Flaithbertach and is the child of someone called Crunmael.  While
automation of the generation of this entry can help (as discussed in
[Human Curation and Digital Datasets: A Problem in Multiple
Parts]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/06/07/Human-Curation-and-Digital-Datasets.html))
but this still requires human intervention.  However if an error is
introduced of the form:

```
<#Flaithbertach>
    a foaf:Person;
    irishRel:nomName "Flaithbertach";
    rel:childOF <#Crunmael>.

```

Notice the difference between `childOf` and `childOF`.  This is subtle
and easily missed even during a full audit.  The effect of this change
is that the predicate is assumed to exist but it has no effect.
Essentially, this means that in the presence of a Triplestore that can
apply reasoning to a triple, no reasoning will apply.  The implication
of this is that now Flaithbertach is not the child of Crunmael and
when searched for under its proper form, `childOf`, it will not
appear.  The system is broken and if this is in a complex query,
incorrect results will be returned to the user.  The old adage
"Garbage In, Garbage Out" but for a user who is not facile with
computers and is not ready to expect this in a human curated database,
it is very frustrating.

There is not much that can be done for this kind of problem overall.
More careful curators and automation can decrease the occurance as
discussed in "Human Curation and Digital Datasets" but this will never
fully elimiate the possibility.

Another form of error can cause real problems in a system.  Take the
below more fleshed out version:

```turtle
@base <http://example.com/LL/dal_corpri_arad.trig> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix rel: <http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/> .

<http://example.com/LL> {
  <#Flaithbertach> a foaf:Person ;
                   rel:childOf <#Crunmael>.
}
```

The above is a full TRiG file that will be parsed successfully by a
system that implements the TRiG file format.  The file above
translated into English states: "In LL, Flaithbertach is a person and
is the child of Crunmael".  As the astute reader will have noticed,
Crunmael is nowhere mentioned.  Due to the Open World Assumption, the
existence of Crumael will be assumed by the system.  In fact, in the
face of reasoning and the `rel` ontology, he will also be assumed to
be a person.  While this can be useful, it can also create "ghost
people" who exist only because a human made a mistake somewhere.
