#Introduction
The 1467 Manuscript is the conventional name for folios 1-9 of [Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland, Adv. MS 72.1.1](https://digital.nls.uk/gaelic-manuscripts-of-scotland/archive/77008664), as, according to a scribal colophon, they were written out around the year 1467 in the Butler castle at [Ballyboe](https://www.logainm.ie/ga/48373), Co. Tipperary, by Dubhghall Albannach Mac Mhic Cathail. They contain for the most part religious tracts and narratives, the contents overlapping to some extent with those of the _[Leabhar Breac](https://www.ria.ie/library/catalogues/special-collections/medieval-and-early-modern-manuscripts/leabhar-breac-speckled)_, which was also produced in Co. Tipperary around half a century earlier. On fol. 1, however, Dubhghall Albannach has inscribed a series of pedigrees of Scottish relevance that trace the ancestry of the kings of Scots, the Lords of the Isles, and the heads of roughly 30 Highland kin-groups. These pedigrees offer rare and valuable insights into the self-conception of the Lordship of the Isles and Gaelic-speaking society on Scotland's western seaboard more generally. We are therefore very pleased to announce that they are now [included in IrishGen](https://github.com/cyocum/irish-gen/tree/master/NLS.Adv.72.1.1/Highland_Pedigrees). This blogpost provides a quick overview of the pedigrees and of scholarly work done on them to date.
